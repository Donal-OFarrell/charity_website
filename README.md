College project using HTML and CSS (no frameworks allowed)- Usage of CSS grid and flexbox

This is a reponsive fron end web application solely using CSS grid and Flexbox. 
Please note that there is no copyright infringement intended for https://territoriodezaguates.com/. 
This is a charity I am passionate about to which I've donated for many years. 

The usage of Bootstrap or other CSS frameowrks was not allowed in this project so i opted to use CSS grid and Flexbox, 
modern features of CSS3, that optimise ease of use when designing repsonsive web pages.
